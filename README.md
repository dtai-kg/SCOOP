# Shapes-Integration
Integrating SHACL shapes derived from diverse source (e.g., RML, OWL, XSD, CSVW, Json Schema)

## Conflict Checking 
The added constraints can not cause the original shape to become unsatisfiable

Confirmed constraint list: 

- [X] class
- [X] nodeKind
- [X] datatype
- [X] minCount 
- [X] maxCount
- [X] minExclusive
- [X] maxExclusive
- [X] minInclusive
- [X] maxInclusive
- [X] minLength
- [X] maxLength
- [X] pattern
- [X] flags
- [X] languageIn
- [X] uniqueLang
- [X] equals
- [X] disjoint
- [X] lessThan
- [X] lessThanOrEquals 
- [X] not
- [X] and 
- [X] or
- [X] xone
- [X] node 
- [X] hasValue
- [X] in
